## Hi there 👋

I’m Sem (S3m01).

I like building things that make computers do the boring parts for me: dashboards, scripts, automations, and web apps that actually get used.

### 🧰 What I mess around with
- APIs and little backend services
- Linux + Docker
- Automations that save time (and sanity)

### 🧪 Currently experimenting with
- Deployments that don’t randomly break at 2 AM

### ⚡ Fun fact
If something takes more than 3 clicks, I immediately want to automate it.
